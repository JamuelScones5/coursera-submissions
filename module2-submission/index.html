	<h2 class="tango">Tango</h2>
	<p>Tango is four years old and loves to play fetch. He's a labrador retriever and doesn't listen to me as much as he listens to my girlfriend, but he loves me because I can throw the ball further than her </p>

<div class = "col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
	<h2 class="coco">Coco</h2>
	<p>Coco is 1 and 3/4 (the only girl pet, the only cat and the smallest of the bunch). Her favourite thing to do is to wake me up at 2am to ask to be let outside to go to the toilet. Then she gets mad when I don't reappear to let her back in until I wake up in the morning</p>
</div>
<div class = "col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
	<h2 class="lima">Lima</h2>
	<p>Lima may be the youngest, but he is also the biggest and most energetic pet. He is also a labrador retriever, and at just over 1 year old he is already bigger than his older brother, Tango. Hopefully he stops growing soon or we'll need a bigger house</p>
